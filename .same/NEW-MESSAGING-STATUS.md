## 📈 Metrics to Track

**Before New Messaging** (Versions 1-43):
- Positioned as: Backend platform (Convex clone)
- Main differentiator: Real-time TypeScript database
- Cost message: Not emphasized

**After New Messaging** (Version 44+):
- Positioned as: Unified platform (Vercel + Convex + AWS replacement)
- Main differentiator: 40-60% cost savings + consolidation
- Cost message: Front and center

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All 24 pages mention unified platform
- [ ] Cost savings mentioned on key pages (Home, Pricing, About, FAQ)
- [ ] "One dashboard, one bill" message appears 10+ times across site
- [ ] GPU/NPU compute mentioned but not overemphasized
- [ ] No Convex-only positioning remains
